# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Aircraft Engines

This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines from sensor data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, deployed with MLOps tools and integrated with RPA bots to automate maintenance reporting.

## Day 1 - Setup & Data Ingestion
- Dataset: NASA C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine Degradation
- Loaded raw sensor data into pandas
- Created project structure and GitHub repo
